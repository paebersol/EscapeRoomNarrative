  Iceberg dead ahead! </p>

<p style="color:DarkSlateGrey; font-size:15px">The year is 1912. You just won a ticket to the trip of a lifetime on a luxury British steamship known as the RMS Titanic to New York City. Unfortunately, the trip takes a turn for the worst after the "unsinkable" ship hits an iceberg and begins to go down. There is 2,240 total passengers and crew on board, with only 16 lifeboats and 4 collapsibles. There is not nearly enough to accommodate everyone. In order to survive, you must make it on to a life boat before they run out of room. </p>
